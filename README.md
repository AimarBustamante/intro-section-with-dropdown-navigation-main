# Frontend Mentor - Intro section with dropdown navigation

![Design preview for the Intro section with dropdown navigation coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëãüèª

### Brief

Your challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
